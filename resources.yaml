        title: "The Art of Command Line"
        url: https://github.com/jlevy/the-art-of-command-line
        description: A wonderful summary from Joshua Levy
            regarding command line (Bash in particular) tools,
            programs, tips and tricks; contains many pointers
            to resources and repositories, in the form of
            "to do this you must know that", which gives great
            pointers but requires further investigation from
            different sources; translated in many languages.

            "Adventures with lightweight and minimalist
            software for Linux": reviews of many command-line
            programs; many programs reviewed (400+, at least),
            with screenshots and animated GIFs; the style of
            presentation is ironic and funny, but requires some
            effort to figure out the real contribution of a program.

        description: >
            A long list of CLI apps from Jared Bernard;
            some are quite outdated; pros: some CLI apps are put
            side-by-side with GUI counterparts; cons: no comments
            to the apps.

            "Some are little-known, some are just too
            useful to miss, some are pure obscure..." from
            Kristof Kovacs; nice list with screenshot; mostly
            oriented to system administration; unfortunately
            there are no clickable links.

            Javascript/Node.js-centered for my tastes.

        description: A site that aims at collecting and organizing
            CLI apps information from user contributions;
            considering its social-oriented nature, it misses
            several mainstream apps.
