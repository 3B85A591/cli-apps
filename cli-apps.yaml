                As the name implies, Task spooler is a Unix batch system 
                that can be used to add the Linux commands to the queue
                and execute them one after the other in numerical order
                (ascending order, to be precise). This can be very useful
                when you have to run a lots of commands, but you don't want
                to waste time waiting for one command to finish and run the
                next command. You can queue it all up and Task Spooler will
                execute them one by one. In the mean time, you can do other
                activities.
