#### [watch](http://www.linfo.org/watch.html)

Periodically runs a command in the console while temporarily clearing the screen content; it makes it easy to check differences between the output of two subsequent commands; it provides "diff" functionality to highlight the changing characters between outputs. 

## <a name="terminals"></a>Terminals

#### [byobu](http://byobu.co/)

## <a name="editors"></a>Editors

#### [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)

One of the godfathers of text editors; free long-standing software project; tons of extensions and funcionalities; the biggest drawback (my taste): it needs [E-Lisp](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/eintr.html) for being programmed.  

#### [jed](http://www.jedsoft.org/jed/index.html)

A text editor with a drop-down menu facility that make it especially user-friendly. 

#### [joe](http://joe-editor.sourceforge.net/)

(Joe's Own Editor) is a compact text editor written in C; a detailed list of features and missing ones is explicitly reported in the website; this editor is mentioned in several web sources for its capability in handling large files. 

#### [nano](https://www.nano-editor.org/)

Easy to use, lightweigth text editor; no complex keybindings to remember. 

#### [micro](https://github.com/zyedidia/micro/)

A terminal-based text editor written in Go that aims to be easy to use and intuitive, while also taking advantage of the full capabilities of modern terminals.  

#### [neovim](https://neovim.io/)

A work in progress attempt to improve [vim](http://www.vim.org/), dropping older/unused OS compatibility, improving the codebase readability, modularity and maintainability; it has chances to become the next choice of vim users. 

#### [slap](https://github.com/slap-editor/slap)

Text editor inspired by [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) written in NodeJS; extedable in Javascript. 

#### [vai](https://github.com/stefanoborini/vai)

A text editor similar to `vim` written in Python; many feature are nicely replicated, some are still missing; however, the advantage of this implementation is its simplicity, maintainability and extensibility, thanks to the Python implementation. 

#### [vim](http://www.vim.org/)

Historically one of the preferred text editors; behavior based on editing modes; plenty of plugins and tips to address every possible editing problem. 

#### [vis](https://github.com/martanne/vis)

"a modern, legacy free, simple yet efficient vim-like editor", and more: "The intention is not to be bug for bug compatible with vim, instead a similar editing experience should be provided. The goal could thus be summarized as 80% of vim's features implemented in roughly 1% of the code"; the editor is scriptable in LUA and supports editing large files. 

#### [WordGrinder](https://cowlark.com/wordgrinder/)

From the website: "WordGrinder is a word processor for processing words. It is not WYSIWYG. It is not point and click. It is not a desktop publisher. It is not a text editor. It does not do fonts and it barely does styles. What it does do is words. It's designed for writing text. It gets out of your way and lets you type." 

## <a name="font"></a>Font management

#### [FIGlet](http://www.figlet.org/)

Not exactly a font manager, but a nice program for making large letters out of ordinary text; an astonishing number of different fonts is available. 

#### [toilet](http://caca.zoy.org/wiki/toilet)

## <a name="text-processing"></a>Text processing

#### [ccat](https://github.com/jingweno/ccat)

A `cat` command with colorized output. 

#### [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)

(FuZzy Finder) is a general-purpose command-line finder with fuzzy search/filter capabilities; good integration with `vim`. 

#### [grc](https://github.com/pengwynn/grc)

(Generic Colouriser) can be configured to parse a given text stream and to colorize it according to regexp written in configuration files; different patterns can be associated to file types. 

#### [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/)

(JSON Query?) is sed-like processor for JSON data; can be used to process JSON files and data streams and perform operations such as those allowed by `cat`, `sed`, `grep` and `awk` on regular text files. 

#### [percol](https://github.com/mooz/percol)

A Python script that "1) receives input lines from  stdin` or a file, 2) lists the input lines and waits for input that filter/select the line(s), 3) outputs the selected line(s) to stdout"; can be used to add interactivity to many regular shell commands. 

#### [q](http://harelba.github.io/q/)

Executes SQL-like queries on CSVs/TSVs tabular data files; each tabular file is treated as a database table; support to all SQL constructs (`WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `JOIN`). 

## <a name="text-search"></a>Text search

#### [ack](http://beyondgrep.com/)

A list of some online resoures that contribute interesting links to apps and info.

[The Art of Command Line](https://github.com/jlevy/the-art-of-command-line) - A wonderful summary from Joshua Levy regarding command line (Bash in particular) tools, programs, tips and tricks; contains many pointers to resources and repositories, in the form of "to do this you must know that", which gives great pointers but requires further investigation from different sources; translated in many languages.

[Inconsolation blog](https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/) - "Adventures with lightweight and minimalist software for Linux": reviews of many command-line programs; many programs reviewed (400+, at least), with screenshots and animated GIFs; the style of presentation is ironic and funny, but requires some effort to figure out the real contribution of a program.


[CLIapps blog table](http://www.jaredandcoralee.com/CLIapps.html) - A long list of CLI apps from Jared Bernard; some are quite outdated; pros: some CLI apps are put side-by-side with GUI counterparts; cons: no comments to the apps.


[A little collection of cool unix terminal/console/curses tools](https://kkovacs.eu/cool-but-obscure-unix-tools) - "Some are little-known, some are just too useful to miss, some are pure obscure..." from Kristof Kovacs; nice list with screenshot; mostly oriented to system administration; unfortunately there are no clickable links.

[CLI-Apps](http://cli-apps.org/) - A site that aims at collecting and organizing CLI apps information from user contributions; considering its social-oriented nature, it misses several mainstream apps.
