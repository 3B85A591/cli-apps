# Awesome list of CLI/TUI programs

This repository contains a list of (mainly) CLI/TUI apps with links and a short description.
To the best of my knowledge, this is the largest collection of CLI/TUI tools available in the form of awesome list.

The peculiarity of this repository is that the source of information is structured into CSV files with a simple structure.
See the `data/` directory.

This `README` file is generated from the CSV files.
To build `README.md` run (`python3` is required for building):

```
make
```
